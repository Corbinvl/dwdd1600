            <h1>Lifestyle tips</h1>
        <h2>Best gear</h2>
            <p>What you decide to wear up to the mountain really depends on the type of skiier you are and what you prefer but I do have some tips to make sure you look the part. Most pros will say if you are doing a lot a tricks or things, you want your gear to be baggy. This is because you are doing a lot of movement and can't have your clothes ristricting you. This is mainly seen in snowboarding just due to the nature of the board compared to skies and is generally more important for them, however can still be seen in skiers.</p>
            <p>When I talk about the type of skier that you are changes how you look this is what I mean. Sking is as much a fasion show as a skill show, however you can't be rocking the fit if you don't have the skill to back it up. One example is the <em>"park rat"</em> look. This is the baggy pant and usually just a hoodie or a sports jersey over their coat. It is a much more causal look and is usually worn by the skiiers that mainly go into the park area to do tricks.</p>
            
        <h2>Resorts</h2>
            <p>There are sop many resorts out there and every single one is different. I'm mainly going to talk about the ones in Utah because those are the ones I know. This season I've been hitting Park City but usually I go to Brighton. As skiing has become more and more popular, Brighton has been harder and harder to get to. Since it is up a single lane canyon and with how much avalanch control has to be done, traffic has become a real issue. Brighton has always been known as the chill resort while other places like Deer Valley or Sundance are a bit more uptight and restrictive. I would recomend checking out Park City Canyons side, (parking resorvations are not required for this side and it is included in your Park City Pass). The address is linked below. I also listed out a few of the Popular ski resorts here in Utah.</p>
