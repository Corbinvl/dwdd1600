       <p>Here are some tips for people who are just learning to ski. The first one is that <strong>pizza is your enemy</strong>. A lot of people will say you can use pizza (where you put the tip of you skis together) is how you slow down. You will notice that  people that are good at skiing, actually only do this when they are getting in the line for the lift or in an already slow area. The best way to slow down is just turning and keeping your skiis parallel with the mountain. This allows for a lot more control when going down the slope.</p>
        <p>Another tips for speed control is learning to do a hockey stop. This is where you go from facing straight into a sharp turn sideways to come to a complete stop. This is really helpfull when there are lots of other people on the mountain and you need to avoid hitting someone.</p>
